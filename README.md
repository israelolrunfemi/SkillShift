# Global SkillShift Event README

## Overview
Global SkillShift is an annual movement and event series aimed at empowering young people across Africa by transforming their skills—or even their uncertainties—into tangible opportunities. The flagship event, **Beyond the Skill**, is a one-day gathering targeting over 1,000 physical attendees, including students, creatives, aspiring entrepreneurs, tech learners, freelancers, and those still figuring out their path in a rapidly evolving world.

The event features a mix of practical learning sessions, mentorship, networking, and direct access to industry leaders, recruiters, and funding sources. Key activities include:
- Panel sessions
- Expert keynotes
- Breakout workshops
- Mentorship circles
- Career positioning clinics

The goal is to help participants master their skills and convert them into income, relevance, and global opportunities. The event is hosted on the University of Lagos (UNILAG) campus, extending reach to over 3,000 students and 5,000 digital viewers.

## Problem Statement
Africa's digital economy is expanding rapidly, but young people face significant barriers beyond a mere talent shortage:
- **Lack of Direction**: Many don't know where to start or how to differentiate between tech skills, digital skills, soft skills, and sustainable skills.
- **Skill Acquisition Without Application**: Individuals complete online courses or training but remain unemployed due to poor self-positioning or lack of connections.
- **Dropout Risks**: Unclear paths lead to abandonment of learning.
- **Monetization Challenges**: Valuable skills exist but aren't packaged, pitched, or monetized effectively.
- **Access Gaps**: Limited exposure to mentors, professional networks, and real-world opportunities leaves many stuck.

**Beyond the Skill** addresses these by bridging potential with opportunity through community building, structured learning, mentorship, and ongoing post-event support. It's inclusive for anyone feeling stuck, overlooked, curious, or ready to grow.
